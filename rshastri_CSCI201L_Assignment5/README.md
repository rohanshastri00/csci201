# Assignment 5 - Website Population using MySQL Database

Summation of Assignments 1, 2, and 3 - Take JSON file as input,
parse to create Java Objects, upload objects information to SQL
database, and then pull from SQL database to create container for
website population. AJAX has been correctly implemented here, and
you can now easily sort on the assignments page - sorting is happening
within the database.

# NOTE: Run .sql script in MySQL Workbench before running index.jsp
