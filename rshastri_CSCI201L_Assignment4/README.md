Initialize BlackJackServer using valid port number,
then start 1-3 instances of BlackJackClient to connect
to server via valid IP address ('localhost') and 
corresponding port.

First client to connect can start a new game, and following
players can connect to this game or start a new one as well.
Upon meeting the correct number of players per game, server
will broadcast to all clients as a group and individually for
betting, followed by dealing cards and then asking to hit or stay
for each player on a turn by turn basis.

# ISSUES WITH SCANNER

Game functionality is sound, but the scanner is having issues 
where it may take several values before the scanner works. 
Please keep this in mind and try entering the same value 
several times to proceed.
